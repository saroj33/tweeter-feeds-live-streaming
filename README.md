## tweeter-feeds-live-streaming
Tweeter feeds live streaming using nodejs as backend server, angular 7.2 as frontend.

Unique socket connection for each instances of frontend server.

Real time twitter statuses with real time filters.

## Getting started (for new beginner on node and angular like me :))
clone the repo to your local computer.

cd inside the twitter-feed-server.

Run "npm install".

Rename config_sample.json to config.json and enter your twitter credentials.

Run "npm start" or "nodemon" (nodemon will restart server automatically everytime there is change in code).

Now cd inside the twitter-feed-frontend.

Run "npm install".

Now run "ng serve --port 3333" http://localhost:3333 .
